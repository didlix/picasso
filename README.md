As is usual when I do a code test, here is a list of everything I think I did wrong:

- Used bad English in the cucumber tests
- Wasted time on cucumber (for personal interest) when I should have saved time writing RSpec tests
- Didn't end up with enough DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

Oh and to run on a Mac (the only platform I tested it on, yes I know "it works on my machine" - "Well let's deploy your machine then") simply:

bin/picasso
